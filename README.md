Script requires installed module Pillow. You can install it just by pip3, open command shell in directory with pip3 and write the following command: pip3 install pillow. After that, you can drop image on python script and it will slice it in tiles. Or you can run script by command shell and destinate how fast it will slice(fast or slow) Example: tiles.png -fast
